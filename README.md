The line map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 100); is used to map the analog sensor value (in this case, the sensorValue read from the MQ-3 alcohol sensor) from its original range (0 to 1023) to a new range (0 to 100). This is a common technique to scale the input values to a more meaningful and manageable range.

The map() function in Arduino takes five arguments:

cpp
Copy code
map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh)
value: The input value to be mapped.
fromLow: The lower bound of the original range of the input value.
fromHigh: The upper bound of the original range of the input value.
toLow: The lower bound of the new range you want to map the input value to.
toHigh: The upper bound of the new range you want to map the input value to.
In this specific case, the sensorValue is a 10-bit ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) value, which can range from 0 (0V) to 1023 (5V) because the Arduino operates with a 5V reference voltage. The MQ-3 alcohol sensor's resistance changes based on the alcohol concentration, and the sensorValue represents that resistance.

Since we want to interpret the sensorValue as an alcohol concentration percentage, the code uses the map() function to transform the original range (0 to 1023) into a new range (0 to 100) to represent the alcohol concentration as a percentage. For example:

sensorValue = 0: Mapped to 0% alcohol concentration.
sensorValue = 511: Mapped to 50% alcohol concentration.
sensorValue = 1023: Mapped to 100% alcohol concentration.
Keep in mind that this mapping assumes a linear relationship between the sensor value and the actual alcohol concentration, which may or may not be entirely accurate for all sensors. Calibration and experimentation may be required to determine the precise relationship between the sensor value and the actual alcohol concentration in your specific setup.
